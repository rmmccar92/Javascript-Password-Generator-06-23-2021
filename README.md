# Javascript Password Generator Homework

In this assignment we were tasked with updating existing code so that when the generate password button in the application was clicked the desired password would appear on the page. Additionally we were asked to include the variables of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters so that the user could pick and choose what they wanted their password to be comprised of.
